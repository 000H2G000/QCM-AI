How to Package and Share Your QCM Helper Extension

1. PACKAGING THE EXTENSION

Method 1: Using Windows Explorer
-------------------------------
1. Create a new folder named "qcm-helper-extension"
2. Copy the following files into this folder:
   - manifest.json
   - background.js
   - content.js
   - popup.html
   - popup.js
   - history.html
   - notes.html
   - README.md
3. Create an "assets" subfolder and copy these files:
   - assets/icon16.png
   - assets/icon48.png
   - assets/icon128.png
4. Select all files and folders in the "qcm-helper-extension" folder
5. Right-click and select "Send to" > "Compressed (zipped) folder"
6. Name the zip file "qcm-helper-extension.zip"

Method 2: Using PowerShell (Advanced)
------------------------------------
1. Open PowerShell and navigate to your extension directory
2. Run the following commands:

```powershell
# Create a temp directory
$tempDir = ".\qcm-helper-extension"
if (Test-Path $tempDir) { Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $tempDir }
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $tempDir | Out-Null
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "$tempDir\assets" | Out-Null

# Copy files
Copy-Item manifest.json, background.js, content.js, popup.html, popup.js, history.html, notes.html, README.md $tempDir
Copy-Item assets\icon16.png, assets\icon48.png, assets\icon128.png "$tempDir\assets"

# Create zip file (PowerShell 5.0 and later)
Compress-Archive -Path "$tempDir\*" -DestinationPath "qcm-helper-extension.zip" -Force

# Clean up
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $tempDir
```

2. SHARING THE EXTENSION

Option 1: Share the ZIP file directly
------------------------------------
1. Share the "qcm-helper-extension.zip" file via email, file sharing services, or USB drive
2. Include the README.md file or these installation instructions:

   Installation Instructions:
   a. Extract the zip file to a folder
   b. Open Chrome or Edge and go to extensions page:
      - Chrome: chrome://extensions/
      - Edge: edge://extensions/
   c. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right)
   d. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extracted folder
   e. The extension should now be installed and ready to use

Option 2: Publish to Chrome Web Store (For Wider Distribution)
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a developer account at the Chrome Web Store (one-time $5 fee)
   - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/

2. Prepare store listing materials:
   - Extension icon (128x128 PNG)
   - At least 1-3 screenshots (1280x800 or 640x400)
   - Short description (up to 132 characters)
   - Detailed description
   - Privacy policy URL (can be a GitHub gist)

3. Submit your extension:
   a. Go to the Chrome Developer Dashboard
   b. Click "New Item" and upload your zip file
   c. Fill in the store listing information
   d. Submit for review (typically takes 2-3 business days)

4. Once approved, share your Chrome Web Store listing URL with others

Notes:
- Users will still see the "Developer mode extensions" warning when using the directly shared zip file
- Publishing to Chrome Web Store provides the most professional and trustworthy distribution method
- Make sure you have properly documented the extension's functionality in the README.md file
